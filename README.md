# Binary Search Tree
## Introduction 
 - Binary Search Tree is the non-linear data Structure in programming used to store the data hierarchically.
 - There are left and right parts of binary search tree. On right hand the data which is greater than root node data will be stored and on left hand the data which is lesser than root node will be accommodated.
 - The leaf nodes are addressing to null.
 - If root is addressing to null it means BST is initially empty.
 - The BST node can have only 0,1 and 2 childrens not more than that.
 - The traversing and run time insertion of new nodes is also possible.
## Traversals of BST 
  - There are three types of main traversals
    ### Inorder Traversal
    - The procedure of inorder traversal is from Left subtree traversal, then root part and lastly right subtree part.
    - Follows order of Left-Root-Right.
    ### Preorder Traversal
    - The procedure of preorder traversal is from Root part, then left subtree traversal and lastly right subtree traversal.
    - Follows order of Root-Left-Right.
    ### Postorder Traversal
    - The procedure of postorder traversal is from Left, then right subtree traversal and lastly traversing root.
    - Follows order to Left-Right-Root.
